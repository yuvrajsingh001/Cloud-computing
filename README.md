# Cloud Computing Project Proposal

Since Covid-19 pandemic hit, every industry that required some form of social interaction suffered due to people quarantining. Every business and service was looking to create an online presence to keep their operations running. Healthcare services in such scenario had to be brought online in order for people to access it from the comfort of their home rather than wasting time waiting for their appointments which would lead to compromising on social distancing. Hence I thought of building a platform wherein people can access information about doctors and hospitals and avail healthcare services. 
## Motivation
The key reasons that motivated me were: 

	To provide a safe, easy and quick way of scheduling appointments.

	To help people access detailed information about different services at one place.

	Providing doctors with a paperless way to access patient information.

	Making user related data more secure.
## Objective and Features
The objective of this project is to give healthcare service an online presence in order for making it easy to securely access for people as well as healthcare workers. 

This is achieved by providing features such as:

	Login/Signup page for both doctors and patients to make it simple to access.

	Accessing information about services through a dynamic website.

	A MySQL RDBMS to access inter-linked data easily and keep user data secure.

	A functionality to book appointments.
## Benefits of Cloud Computing
	Load Balancing: Distributes the user traffic among different different servers which protects the servers from overloading and stops downtime.

	Scalability: Provides variety of resources such as storage, automation which otherwise would have been difficult to access.

	Cost Effective as compared to Traditional IT infrastructure.
## Technologies Used
	NGINX : To balance incoming traffic

	PHP-FPM : To improve performance of website

	HTML, CSS, JS : Frontend Design

	PHP : To communicate with database using MySQL

	MyPHPAdmin : To deploy SQL database for user data

	Redis : To store local website data

	Docker-Compose : To setup multiple containers simultaneously.

	Docker-Swarm : Creates a cluster of nodes to improve reliability.
